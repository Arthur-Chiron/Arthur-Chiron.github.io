I am a french PhD student within the [DEEL (DEpendable and Explainable Learning)](https://www.deel.ai) project at [ANITI (Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute)](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr). My research interests include machine learning, deep learning, and their applications to computer vision.
