I am a french PhD student within the [DEEL (DEpendable and Explainable Learning)](https://www.deel.ai) project at [ANITI (Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute)](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr). My research focuses on self-supervised learning for explainable and certifiable generic models applied to medical image analysis, with a specific application in the automatic identification of cell types.

I hold a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from Paul Sabatier University, where I also completed a double bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. Throughout my studies, I’ve worked on several research projects, including archaeological remote sensing and machine learning acceleration for radiotherapy scheduling.
